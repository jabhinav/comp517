# Comp517 Project Proposal

Written proposal for the project that states the problem
you will address, the motivation for why this is an
interesting problem, the goal of your project, the
relationship between your project and other work, the plan
and methodology for your project, and the resources needed
to carry out your project. Include a set of incremental
milestones that you will achieve in carrying out the project
and a schedule for meeting these milestones.

## Assignment Requirements

You will write a proposal with the following high level
section:

1. Introduction
2. Background
3. Methods and Plan
4. Milestones

The proposal should be no longer than 5 pages. Each major
section is described below.

### Introduction

You will write an introduction with the following key points
(closely related to the [Seven Key
Questions](../resources/seven-questions.pdf)). These
questions mirror the research questions you expect to pull
out of any original scholarly work. Each of these should be
approximately 1-2 paragraphs. The following sections will
provide elaboration of these elements.

1. Problem + why it's important
2. Research context or gap in existing approaches
3. The aim/goal/hypothesis (typically a single sentence, but
   can be longer)
4. The proposed solution: how will you solve it?
5. How you will evaluate it?
6. Anticipated Contributions

### Background

Detail a few specific elements of the problem that are
necessary to understand the work. This can be an expanded
version of the problem as mentioned in the introductory
paragraph. 

### Proposed Approach and Evaluation Plan

Detail the early design of the solution. Also describe how
you plan to evaluate it. 

### Expected Resources

What will you need to accomplish your goal?

### Milestones

Itemize a list of deadlines that allow for incremental role
out of the work.

## Grading Rubric

The proposal will be evaluated in the same way that each
research paper we read is. Key elements will include:

1. Does the proposal clearly articulate the problem and its
   importance, 
2. related work on the problem, 
3. a novel hypothesis (claim about the method/idea to solve), 
4. a method for demonstrating the hypothesis, 
5. a feasible and strong plan for evaluation, 
6. and a plan for carrying out the work.

The proposal will receive equal weighting for the above
elements. I will also grad with regard to clarity of
writing, but will place less emphasis here, however, note
that to clearly describe those points you must have clear
writing.

## Notes on Proposal Writing

There are many ways to brainstorm for writing a proposal. I
have used all of these in my writings before. The above
requirements and rubric most closely follows the CARS method
while including a plan element. 

### Abstracts

Abstracts are tiny texts that allow you to explore the
entire argument distilled into a few statements. They
typically have a form like the following (examples
included):

- **Locate/Context**: C memory safety research provides powerful
  protection against adversaries
- **Focus/Condition**: However, all existing approaches use
  imprecise analysis and thus attacks remain
- **Main-Claim/Response**: This paper presents an approach that
  eliminates all imprecision by getting developer
  annotations. The core insight is...
- **Report/Methods**: A prototype of the system is produced
  that obtains zero imprecision with [costs] and addresses
  all threats.
- **Argue**: Overall, we find our approach to significantly
  address the problem without costing too much and can lead
  to future work in securing our systems through ...

The abstract is one of my favorite texts to write because it
forces me to be focused and to distill the problem to only
the essential aspects of the work. It is a key writing in
the development of the scholar as it forces you to take a
position of authority in the conversation and make a claim
to contribution.

### CARS

Projects may optionally include a CARS section. This section
lays out an argument for the work. It is typically a
precursor to a full paper, but is a mini-write up that
allows the argument to be played with at scale. 

It typically has a few parts:

1. Problem and relevancy; trend
2. Show the gap: existing work tries to do something but
   fails to adequately address some problem
3. Fill the gap: our work will resolve this problem by doing
   X

Please see links for further exploration of the CARS method.

### Sketch

Some projects may just be half baked and need to get a quick
statement on them to share the basics of the idea. This can
be done with a sketch. 

1. Problem?
2. Simple insight/hunch
3. Expected outcome

A sketch is similar to an abstract, and may be one. This
could also be described as answering Heilmeier's Catechism. 

### Heilmeier's Catechism

- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives
  using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current
  practice?
- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will
  be successful?
- Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it
  make?
- What are the risks?
- How much will it cost?
- How long will it take?
- What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for
  success?  

### [Griswold How to Read](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html)

- Motivations: 1) People problem, 2) Technical Problem + why
  isn’t solved, 3) Research question
- What is the proposed solution: hypothesis
- How will you evaluate it?
